### Prevalence of underlying conditions, by age  

Data on the prevalence of underlying conditions were extracted by age, sex, and country from GBD 2017 using the GBD results tool and combined with UN mid-year population estimates for 2020 for the 188 countries available.  
  
The proportion at **increased risk**, shown in orange, was calculated as 1 minus the probability of not having any risk conditions $c_1$, $c_2$, $c_3$... 
<br/>
$$1 – (1 – p(c_1)) \cdot (1 – p(c_2)) \cdot (1 – p(c_3))...$$
You can navigate the plots by showing and comparing data on hover, checking and unchecking multiple conditions, capturing the plot as a `.png` file, etc.
