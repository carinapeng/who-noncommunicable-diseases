**This tool estimates the number (%) of people at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease due to underlying health conditions.**  

People with underlying health conditions are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease. PAHO/WHO defines severe disease as “severe acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough, shortness of breath; AND requiring hospitalization)”. Identifying and quantifying (and eventually locating at the finest granularity available) how many people are at increased risk of COVID-19 (and where) due to the presence of one or more underlying conditions can be a crucial element for several public health policies, including but not restricted, to the following:   
1. Targeted public health messages  
2. Planning health care personnel  
3. Planning for medical equipment, devices and supplies  
4. The use of digital technologies, telemedicine and teleconsultations  
5. Distribution of medications and drugs  
6. Eventually for the prioritization of shielding strategies (such as vaccines) if and when available, etc.
